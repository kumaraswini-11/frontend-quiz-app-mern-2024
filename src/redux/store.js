   ===============================================================================================
   In Redux Toolkit, "serializable" refers to the ability of the state and actions in your store to be easily converted to a plain JavaScript object and serialized to JSON. Redux includes a "serializability check" to catch mistakes where non-serializable values are accidentally included in the state.

   During development, Redux Toolkit's default middleware, `serializableCheck`, performs these checks. It ensures that both the state and actions dispatched to the store are serializable.

   When you disable the serializability check, as done in your Redux store configuration with `serializableCheck: false`, you're informing Redux Toolkit to skip these checks. This can be useful when intentionally including non-serializable values in the state, such as functions, promises, or other complex objects managed by libraries like Immer.

   Every time we refresh the page, the data will be gone from the store, and this is the default behavior of the store. So, to keep the data alive, we have to store it in the local storage. But we don't need to do it manually; we have an npm package called 'redux-persist,' which will perform this task for us."
